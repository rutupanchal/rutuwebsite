<h3 id="understanding-the-problem">Understanding the Problem</h3>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>Mintpro is a B2B2C Insurance selling platform. The users range from novice users who want to start their insurance advisory business to highly experienced insurance advisors who want access to our larger product offerings (otherwise unavailable to them).
One of our biggest concern was the low self veriication rate on 4%. We had to dedicate an operations team to call the rest of the users to help them with the verification process. This was a huge blocker to scaling up the user base.</p>
