# Call for Participation

Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the emerging technologies in several domains including education. When adopted for classrooms, this technology holds great potential in enhancing the motivation in the students to master the course content. Studies have also claimed that there is an increase in student learning and achievement in the educational environment using an AR experience. Enhancement of certain capabilities like problem-solving skills, collaborative learning, and spatial abilities have been the stated reasons for the increased learning achievement. While the AR applications are developed to be used in classrooms using hand-held devices like mobile or tablets, certain guidelines are suggested in creating such an AR learning environment. These guidelines are drawn towards providing an enriched learning experience for the students while using the AR-based solutions in classrooms, thus challenging the traditional teaching-learning process. However, it is required to understand why and what strategies, decisions, methods lie behind the guidelines that are adopted while designing a mobile AR learning experience for K12 classrooms. 

The goal of the workshop is to provide an opportunity for the researchers, designers, developers, and practitioners to come together and submit their original ideas in the form of work-in-progress papers, position papers, and demos regarding mobile-based AR learning experience for K12 classrooms. At the workshop, we will have activities and collaborative discussions to encourage active participation among the participants to have insights generated on the strategies and patterns that are commonly followed while designing such an experience.

We invite submissions concerning, but not limited to, the following subjects/topics for a Mobile AR learning experience for K12 classrooms:
1. Applications and use cases, their design and development
2. User Interface, User Experience design for such applications
3. Components of AR impacting the learning process
4. The methods of designing and research
5. Guidelines considered in the design process
6. Decisions and challenges in the design of the content
7. The role of designer, developer, researcher and/or practitioner
8. Evaluation and/or usability of the designed learning content

The workshop's papers will be published in <a href="https://ismar20.org/" target="_blank">ISMAR 2020</a> adjunct Proceedings and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp" target="_blank">IEEE Xplore</a>.

# Workshop Agenda
The workshop will be held online. The one-day workshop will involve paper presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on sessions. The participants are expected to present their work involving the outlook, and/or approaches taken in providing an AR learning experience in K12 classrooms. The videos demonstrating the different types of applications or solutions can be shown and discussed. The participants will also be encouraged to ideate and create a paper prototype in designing such an experience based on certain given scenarios.

- 20 mins - Ice-Breaker: 
The participants and the organizers do a quick round of introduction
- 30 mins - Presentation (Round 1): <br> 
Presentation of the submitted papers and analyzing the strategies, guidelines, methods, and/or decisions involved in the work.
- 45 mins - Collaborative Activity 1: <br> 
Participants are given a context. They collaborate and work in groups to generate the design briefs around the given context.
- 10 mins: Break
45 mins - Discussion: 
The design briefs generated based on the scenario and discussions are discussed for each group.
- 30 mins - Presentation (Round 2): <br>
Presentation of the submitted papers and analyzing the strategies, guidelines, methods, and/or decisions involved in the work.
- 1 hour - Break 
- 45 mins - Collaborative Activity 2: <br>
Based on the design briefs generated, the groups continue to work on discussing and generating the strategies, design decisions, and/or guidelines for designing a mobile-based AR learning experience for K12 classrooms. 
- 15 mins - Break
- 1 hour - Presentation and Discussion: <br>
The groups present, discuss, argue, and reflect upon the strategies, design decisions, and methods adopted.
- Remaining Time - Reflections: 
Summary and concluding notes on identifying the design patterns.
